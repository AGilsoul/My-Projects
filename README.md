# My Projects
A portfolio of some of my programming projects that I feel showcase my skills as a programmer. Most of these are machine learning or math related, and implement what I have learned in my math and CS courses.

Project Descriptions can be found in the descriptions.md file within each folder

Notable/Favorite Projects:
* C++/ConvNeuralNet - A C++ program containing a convolutional neural network class that I coded from scratch using what I had learned in my calculus classes pertaining to gradients. Can identify handwritten digits with 97% accuracy.
* Python/EdgeExtraction - A python program that passes vertical and horizontal filters over images to extract edges, also uses C++ methods from a dynamic library that I wrote utilizing CUDA to speed up processing time.
