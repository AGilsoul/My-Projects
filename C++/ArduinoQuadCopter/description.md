ArduinoQuadCopter Description:
* This is a program I wrote for controlling an Arduino Quadcopter. It utilizes a magnetometer and gyroscope for orientation data, and is controlled using a PID controller that I wrote. This project has not been updated in a while, as I have not had the time to test more PID values with the quadcopter.
