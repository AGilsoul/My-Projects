1410(FinalProject): 
* In this project, I made a command line program that utilized a CSV file containing all production cars sold in the United States in 2020 to find the best car for a user to fit their needs based on certain preferances such as build, mileage, drivetrain, and so on. It implements a selection sort to sort cars based on horsepower, mileage, and price. The user is greated by a menu from which they can filter the list, sort the list, and do a google search for the cars currently in the list.
