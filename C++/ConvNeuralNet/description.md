ConvNeuralNet Description:
* This is probrably my favorite program that I've written. Similar to my Artificial Neural Network, this is programmed all from scratch, with all of the gradient computations and convolutions programmed by me. It can obtain up to 97% accuracy when identifying handwritten digits.
