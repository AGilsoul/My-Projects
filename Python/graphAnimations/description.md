graphAnimations Description

VectorUtils.py:
* This file contains a Vector class and a Quaternion class. Both classes have a variety of methods, and most of the math I have coded in myself. Only the Vector class is used in plotting currently, but I plan to use the Quaternion class as well when calculating rotations.

quaternion_test.py:
* This is a program I wrote to display the utility and functionality of quaternions for the UCubeSat club, it has a console menu that can perform various operations on vectors with quaternions using VectorUtils.py. 

vector_Animation.py:
* This program animates various vectors of the form <x(t), y(t), z(t)> using matplotlib and functions from VectorUtils.py.
