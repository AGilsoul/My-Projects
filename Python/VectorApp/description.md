VectorApp Description

VectorUtils.py:
* This file contains a Vector class and a Quaternion class. Both classes have a variety of methods, and most of the math I have coded in myself. Only the Vector class is used in plotting currently, but I plan to use the Quaternion class as well when calculating rotations.

VectorPlot.py:
* This file is mainly for creating various vector plots in matplotlib using the VectorUtils.py file

VectorPlotGUI.py:
* This is the file that gets run, it creates a window that contains a GUI for doing various vector computations, such as cross products and projections
