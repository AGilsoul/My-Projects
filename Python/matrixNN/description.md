matrixNN Description:

matrixNeuralNet.py:
* This is a program I wrote after I wrote my neural networks in C++. It is written in a similar fashion in that I wrote most of the math myself, however, for this program I used NumPy for matrix multiplication. I have tested it on a dataset containing information on residential structures, and it can predict the energy cooling load of these structures with high accuracy, getting an R^2 value of up to 0.98.
